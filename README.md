- Re-organize the codebase.
- Create new modules/methods/components.

# RESULTS

## Online version

Sever and client are separately deployed to two popular hosting services.

- Client: https://omise.now.sh/
- Server: https://omise.herokuapp.com/

Note:

- The client was automatically deployed whenever the code was pushed to master branch
- The server will reset database after a certain period of idle time.

## How to use

### Start website

In order to have a better user experience, this setup uses the aforementioned online server instead the local version which is too fast to show the loading.

If you are prefer the old version of server, feel free to change `BASE_API` in `src/common/constant`

```sh
yarn client
```

URL: http://0.0.0.0:3000/

### Test coverage

```sh
yarn test:coverage
```

## Notes

- Using USD as the only currency of the application

## Limitations

- Webpack is configed at a very basic level
- Not 100% percent of code was coveraged by test
- Not handle lazy loading images
- Paging
- No code spliting
